Blog
https://github.com/danielcgilibert/blog-template # best - wonderful table of contents highlighting on the left, and a very readable design
https://github.com/mickasmt/astro-nomy # dangerously good, nice overview grid layout but the articles themselves have no table of contents
https://github.com/ixartz/astro-boilerplate # cute blog avatar and straightforward black-gray-teal color scheme
https://github.com/godruoyi/gblog # has comments section and decent tech blog marketing-like visual design but terrible scroll hijacking
https://github.com/roadmapsh/deprecated-version # complicated, but decent and with pretty fast rendering of the diagram navigation
https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari # cluttered design, but great rendering of remote GitHub content as a cards, could combine with the comments section feature above
