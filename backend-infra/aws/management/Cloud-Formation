Ideally developers are able to leverage AWS services and create optimized architectures for their applications. This solution addresses the risk and empowerment concerns by using AWS Service Catalog to exposed hardened AWS services to developers.
By leveraging AWS Service Catalog products for each AWS Service; developers can create their own architectures with a self-service experience.
This solution provides CloudFormation templates to make it easier for developers to automate the provisioning of the Service Catalog products.

Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels, you can easily build and deploy Machine Learn
ing (ML) models to identify custom objects which are specific to your business domain in images without requiring advanced ML knowledge. When combined with Amazon Augmented AI (A2I), you can quickly integrate a ML workflow to capture and label images with a human workforce for model training. As ML lifecycle is an iterative and repetitive process, you need to implement an effective workflow that can provide for continuous model training with new data and automated deployment. Your workflow also needs to be flexible enough to allow for changes without requiring development rework as your business objectives change. Operationalizing an effective and flexible
workflow can be resource intensive, especially for customers who have limited machine learning capabilities. In this post, we will use AWS Step Functions,
AWS Lambda, and AWS System Manager Parameter Store to automate a configurable ML workflow for Rekognition Custom Labels and A2I. We will provide an overview of the solution and instructions to deploy it with AWS CloudFormation.
