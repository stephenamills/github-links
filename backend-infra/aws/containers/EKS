https://github.com/aws-samples/unified-log-aggregation-and-analytics # The proposed solution shows and approach to unify and centralize logs across different compute platforms like EC2, ECS, EKS
and Lambda with Kinesis Data Firehose using log collection agents (EC2 Kinesis agent), log routers (Fluentbit and Firelens) and lambda extension. We can easily deploy the solution presented here on the customer site using the CDK scripts packaged part of this article. Amazon managed Elastic search with Kibana is used to visualize the logs collected across different applications running on different compute platforms.
