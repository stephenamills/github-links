long polling. Recently server-sent events (SSE) has become a popular technology to push updates to clients. Ingesting this type of data source into AWS requires a client to be running continuously to receive those events. This sample shows how to connect to an SSE endpoint using AWS Fargate. This sample creates a docker image with a simple SSE client which publishes to an Amazon Kinesis Data Streams stream, then we simply store the event data in Amazon S3.
