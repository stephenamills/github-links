This CloudFormation template example demonstrates how you can add signed URL into the manifest file by using Lambda@Edge, which can be useful when some of your viewers doesn't support cookies.

identifier which is stored in a DynamoDB database. Each request will check the identifier against values stored in the database. If the identifier is found the file process continues and the files is received, the id is then removed from the database. If the identifier is not found the system will perform a 302 redirect to a specified URL.

https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cloudfront-real-time-metrics-sample # This repository provides infrastructure and code to parse CloudFront real-time logs and convert these logs into CloudWatch custom metrics. These Custom metrics in CloudWatch can provide low-level insight into how well a CloudFront distribution is performing and even enable monitoring the operational health of specific CloudFront edge locations. This can assist in the identification of common problems affecting CloudFront distributions such as localized outages, ISP failures, and DNS routing issues.
