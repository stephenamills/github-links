This enables client-side load balancing
to improve latency and costs. For advanced use cases it enables gRPC to leverage the metadata attached to each registered service instance in AWS Cloud Map. This sample is implemented in Golang. This sample will demonstrate how to use AWS Cloud Map to fulfill the auto-discovery of services in the context of microservices
