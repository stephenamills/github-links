https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/gke-tracing-demo # This project introduces you to Stackdriver's tracing feature, and provides a distributed tracing example that can serve as a basis for your own applications. You will deploy a multi-tier application to a Kubern
etes Engine cluster and trace calls between the components. https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/opentelemetry-trace-codelab-go #
https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/gke-istio-telemetry-demo # This project demonstrates how to use an Istio service mesh in a single Kubernetes Engine cluster alongside Prometheus, Jaeger, and Grafana, to monitor cluster and workload performance metrics. You will
first deploy the Istio control plane, data plane, and additional visibility tools using the provided scripts, then explore the collected metrics and trace data in Grafana.
