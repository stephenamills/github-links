https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/elcarro-oracle-operator # El Carro is a new project that offers a way to run Oracle databases in Kubernetes as a portable, open source, community driven, no vendor lock-in container orchestration system. El Carro provides a power
ful declarative API for comprehensive and consistent configuration and deployment as well as for real-time operations and monitoring. https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/slo-monitoring-using-terraform #
https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/prometheus # The Prometheus monitoring system and time series database. GCP fork to export to Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus. Main branch is kept at parity with upstream - see branches or tags for Google's additions.
https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/gke-datadog-demo # This project demonstrates how a third party solution, like Datadog, can be used to monitor a Kubernetes Engine cluster and its workloads. Using the provided manifest, you will install Datadog and a simple nginx
workload into your cluster. The Datadog agents will be configured to monitor the nginx workload, and ship metrics to your own Datadog account. https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/gke-istio-telemetry-demo # This project demonstrates how to use an Istio service mesh in a single Kubernetes Engine cluster alongside Prometheus, Jaeger, and Grafana, to monitor cluster and workload performance metrics. You will
first deploy the Istio control plane, data plane, and additional visibility tools using the provided scripts, then explore the collected metrics and trace data in Grafana. https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/bigquery-long-running-jobs-metric-exporter # Google Cloud Workflow that exports a custom metric into Google Cloud Monitoring for "long running jobs". A job is defined as long running if it is still running at the point the Workfl
ow executes, and it has been running for longer than the defined threshold.
