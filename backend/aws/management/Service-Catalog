Ideally developers are able to leverage AWS services and create optimized architectures for their applications. This solution addresses the risk and empowerment concerns by using AWS Service Catalog to exposed hardened AWS services to developers. By leveraging AWS Service Catalog products for each AWS Service; developers can create their own architectures with a self-service experience. This solution provides CloudFormation templates to make it easier for developers to automate the provisioning of the Service Catalog products.
