https://github.com/aws-samples/api-gateway-websocket-saas-rate-limiting-using-aws-lambda-authorizer # When creating a SaaS multi-tenant systems which require websocket connections we need a way
to rate limit those connections on a per tenant basis. With Amazon API Gateway you have the option to use usage plans with HTTP connections however they are not available for websockets. To enable rate limiting we can use a API Gateway Lambda Authorizer to validate a connection and control access. Using a Lambda Authorizer we can implement code to allow the system to valid connection rates and throttle inbound connections on a per tenant basis. This sample also demonstrates pool and silo modes for handling the message traffic per tenant. https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-hotdog-detector # This example shows you how to build a serverless hotdog detecting application on AWS using Amazon Rekognition, AWS Lambda, and Amazon
